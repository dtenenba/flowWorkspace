\title{Class GatingHierarchy}
\description{
  GatingHierarchy is a class for representing the gating
  hierarchy,which can be either imported from a flowJo
  workspace or constructed in R.
}
\details{
  There is a one-to-one correspondence between
  GatingHierarchy objects and FCS files in the flowJo
  workspace. Each sample (FCS file) is associated with it's
  own GatingHierarchy. It is also more space efficient by
  storing gating results as logical/bit vector instead of
  copying the raw data.

  Given a GatingHierarchy, one can extract the data
  associated with any subpopulation, extract gates, plot
  gates, and extract population proportions. This
  facilitates the comparison of manual gating methods with
  automated gating algorithms.
